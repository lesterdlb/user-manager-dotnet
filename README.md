# User manager

Simple user administration application built with ASP.NET Core MVC (Frontend) and ASP.NET Core Web API (Backend).

Initially, the application was built with ASP.NET Core MVC only. Then, I decided to add ASP.NET Core Web API to the project. The reason for this is that I wanted to put into practice some of the concepts that I really like, such as CQRS and Mediator pattern.

## Features

- User registration
- User login
- User logout
- Role management

## Technologies

- .NET 7
- ASP.NET Core MVC

## TODO
